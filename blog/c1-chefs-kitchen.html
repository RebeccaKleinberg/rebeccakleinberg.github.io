        Dev Bootcamp's hoslistic and integrative approach to learning was a huge factor in my choice to attend. I appreciate the encouragement of being openly curious, hard-working, persistant and ambitious, but also conciencious of my needs and the needs of others. I am a highly social animal, so I'm excited to work with and learn from the educators and my cohort.

         Coming in, I had the impression that DBC wants to teach me how to work hard and learn in a way that is sustainable, not a burn-out. I deeply desire the intellectual skills to do exceptional things, but also the skills to sustain high levels of productivity. This means self-care, physically and mentally. This is what I want for myself not only for my education, but in the long-term of my career and personal projects.

        Interpersonal and self-awareless skills are important to improve on, and I am lucky that DBC bundles these skills with the education that I want the most. I consider now the be the personal development opportunity of my lifetime so far. Pass the grape juice, because I am all in with DBC.
