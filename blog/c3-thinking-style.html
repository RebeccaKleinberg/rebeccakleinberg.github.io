        My Gregorc Thinking style is Abstract Sequential.The "abstract" aspect of this assessment rings true. In order to understand, I need to sit in the ideas, look at them closely, and experience them. That means writing out all the code presented as examples in the textbooks, and looking at them step-by-step, and playing with them to try to find or create errors. I like to learn what is right, but also what to know what is wrong, and why.

        It's true that I like a linear progression through the work. I print out the assignment page every week to stay on track, and work through it methodically. And it's also true that my biggest fear is not having time to go through the material. I don't like skimming, I don't glean a lot from it. I want to go deep into the details of the material.

        Through this process I am developing my learning style. I am implementing certain practices that keep me working and on track. The "Pomodoro Method" works me for in chucking my studies in 25 minute increments so that I don't burn out. But I am finding that I can do five Pomodoros before I need a bigger break. I track this on my white board at home, and try to do at least three chucks of five pomodoros each day. What satisfaction to see 15 boxes crossed off at the end of the day!

        On the subject of the "Growth vs. Fixed Mindset", a fixed mindset holds the belief that the mind has one way of being, and isn't flexible in it's capabilities. The growth mindset believes that capabilities are flexible and able to development. To this effect, I choose to believe that I can develop study habits and capabilities that may not be natural or practiced. For instance, Dev Bootcamp will often recommend I skim an article or textbook chapter. I can follow the instructions, and by doing <span></span>o, I will get better at skimming and gain value from it.
