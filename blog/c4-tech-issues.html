    <h1>Diversity and Opportunity in the Tech Sector</h1>
    <h2>Within the problem lies the solution</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
      There are numerous issues in the tech industry, one of which being that there is not a lot of diversity in tech employees and leaders, and other being that there are way more open positions in the industry than there are skilled workers fill the positions. In the last year or so, there has been more attention to these issues, as individuals and political leaders are seeing the need to focus on building the sector of skilled tech workers. I believe that the solution to this problem is to create programs for more people to get development skills, focusing on creating more oppertunites for woman and underreprsented people to join the tech sector. The only way for there to be more diversity in the tech industry is for more diverse people to join the industry. This will solve the issue of lack of diversity and the need for more skilled workers in the field.
