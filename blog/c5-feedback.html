      <h3>Pairing</h3>
        <p>
          Pairing is one of the most valuable aspects of the learning process in DBC. By pairing, I have to oppertunity to learn from my cohorts. It seems that every time I pair, there are aspects to the problem that I don't understand, that my cohort can teach me, and there are aspects that I have knowledge about that I can teach to my cohort. We approach the problem together, and if we get stuck, one or the other or both can help to get unstuck. This keeps the educational process moving along. It's a great sense of satisfacton when we solve a problem, and get to share in the satisfaction together. It can, at times, be difficult for me not to speed through the process or try to take over and run the show. Peer pairing for me in a practice in patience and listening.

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Reading my feedback made me the most emotional I have been through this learning process. When first looking at the feedback, I was anxious about seeing criticism. I was concerned that I would recieve reports that I am pushy, or try to hard to take the lead. I was surprised to read all positive feedback, and I had an emotional moment of clarity: That although feedback can be used to iron out little issues in working with other, the real value in feedback is positive feedback itself. It has been years since anyone had told me that I am good at what I am doing. Getting positve feedback makes me feel good about what I am doing, and encourages me to continue. The biggest piece of advice that I received, the advice that I am trying to take to heart, is for me to calm down, slow down and try to enjoy the process. Whomever gave me that advice was absolutely right! It useful to be able to see yourself though someone elses eyes, as someone who is smart and capable, but also can improve.
