    <h1>The Realness: Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h2>“The thing women have yet to learn is nobody gives you power. You just take it. ” ~ Rosanne Barr</h2>

    <section>
      <p>In Claude M. Steele's groundbreaking research, he has witnessed and studied to he phenomena of Stereotype Theat. He explains this, in his own words (edited for clarity), as "Being in a situation...for which a negative stereotype about one of your identities is or could be applied to you...at that moment, often implicit, you have the realization that you could be judged or treated in terms of that. If you care about what you are doing...the prospect of being negatively stereotyped or reduced to a stereotype can interfere with your functioning in that situation." During time of frustration that comes up in any difficult situation, that the frustration is attributed to the identification with the stereotype. This creates anxiety and self-doubt, and creates a negative feedback loop that stunts the person and makes it difficult for him or her to proceed, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>This rang true to me upon reading about it, because when I was making the decision to get a solid education, change my career and join the tech industry professionally, I was aware that I am not like a lot of people in the industry. I am female, and the industry has proven to be, in some cases, inhospitable to woman. Also, I am a career changer in my 30's, older than many newcomers in this youth-based industry. Never-the-less, I decided that I needed to pursue my unyielding curiosity to learn to code, and I wanted to be an educated professional with a valuable and expandable skill set that no one could take away from me. I had read somewhere that woman average about 15 years in the industry. In making my decision to go along this path, one of the justifications I made to myself was, "I'll probably want to do something different in 15 years anyway."</p>
      <p>I see now how limiting this is. In the same way a fixed mindset can limit how much one can learn and grow, adhering to and internalizing this stereotype is detrimental to the long-term of my career. Why should I think that I am only going to be in this field for 15 years? Why should I place a limit on myself? Sandi Metz, author of POODR, a wildly popular Ruby design book, has a 30+ years career in the industry, and her career continues to grow. I strongly feel that the only way for woman to have more presence and power in the industry is for more woman to join the industry.</p>
      <p>Learning about Stereotype Threat has benefitted me in helping me recognize the stereotypes and limitations that I was making on myself. With this knowledge, I can take the steps that Dr. Steele recommends to mitigate Stereotype Threat. I can relax into my career choice, and let the concerns about the longevity of my career dissipate. I can disallow stereotypes about being a woman in tech to effect me. I recognize that they exist, but I don't need to internalize them.
