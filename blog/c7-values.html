    <h1>Values & Self-Awareness</h1>
    <h2>Beat Stereotype Threat, Every Time</h2>

    <section>
    <p>
        When looking at the value list, the values that jumped out at me was my connection to community, and personal time. I tend to be an extravert/introvert. I am quite a social animal, and I tend to have friends in a lot of different circles. My friendships are extremely important to me. In addition to that, I also need my personal time, and can hide away from the world from time to regenerate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last time someone asked me for advice was when a friend of mine, who had an issue with a person whom he worked with. They had done business together in the past, but because of bad work situation, which was the fault of neither party, he didn't know if they were going to be able to work together in the future. I advised my friend to give the relationship some time and space to smooth over, and let the tension settle. I advised that once tempers had calmed down, he should talk to his business associate to smooth things over. I think that I was able to give this advice because I have an understanding of how conflicts in relationships work,  and reflects my values.
      </p>

        When I think about my values, I realize that I have what I need to confront my own stereotype threat and mediate it. I can talk it out with someone who I know will listen, or I can be honest with myself and come to terms with stereotype threat, and find the strength in combat it myself. I have all the tools I need. I can count on my community and myself. My community also includes DBC, my cohorts and the faculty. If I'm feeling down, I can reach out to them, or my personal community, or inside to find my own personal strength and self-care.
