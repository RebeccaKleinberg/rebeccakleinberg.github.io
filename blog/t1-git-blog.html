  <h2>Considerations on git, GitHub and version control</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        There aren't many times in life where you get to have a do-over, but with version control software, you can do just that! Version control software allows you to save your work as you go along and access it at every point along the line when you saved it. You can go back to see exactly what changes you made. You don't like the direction your code is going in? Programed in a bug and crashed? Do-over!! You can easily back up to exactly where you work was the way you wanted it, and continue to work from there. You can use git, a version control program that lives on your PC, to save versions of your work by making a "commit." That is, periodically saving your work to this version control software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have made a "commit", you can then push your work to a version control hosting site, such as the GitHub. GitHub is different than git in that it is internet-based, while git exists only on your PC. GitHub will host all the saved and pushed versions of your work. GitHub is an ideal option for many reasons. The biggest one it it's a centralized place for teams to work from, so teammembers can work at one project at one time. It's also an organized place that can be accessed anywhere, even when you aren't close to your PC.
