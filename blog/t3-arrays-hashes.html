    <h1>Let's Hash This Out</h1>
    <h2>A study on Hashes and Arrays</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        Hashes and Arrays are used repeatedly in Ruby, both strong Classes which can be use to create powerful program with lots of options to control what the program does. Arrays are ordered list of objects, meaning that each individual object in the list can be accessed by it's place in the list, i.e.by it's index number. Array's can hold all types of objects such as numbers, string, even other arrays. Here is an examaple of an array:
      </p>
         <code>
          array = ["a", 3, ["Rebecca", "cool"]]
        </code>
      <p>
        Hashes are ordered pairs of objects, using a key and a value. Each value is associated with a specific key, and keys cannot be repeated in the Hash, although values can. Ruby will remeber the order that the keys were inputed into the Hash, and the key effectively becomes and acts like the index. There are many ways to establish Hashes, here is an example of the most common one, the Hash literal constructor:
      </p>
        <code>
          my_hash = {
          :key1 => val1;
          :key2 => val2;
        }
        </code>
      <p>
        Arrays and Hashes are powerful tools. I'm excited learn more about what I can do to use and manipulate them.
      </p>

      <p>
         Fun fact: an Array is a Hash! It is a hash were the inputs are values, and the keys are implied as the index numbers.
