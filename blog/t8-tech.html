    <h1>Recognizing Feelings in Conflicts</h1>
    <h2>for the sake of handling them well</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        In what was probably the most self-inflicted embarrassing moment have ever experienced, I once got into a screaming match with a former friend at a sushi restarurant, much to the mortification of me, her, the patrons of the restaurant, the staff and the chefs. The source of the conflict, on the surface, was her anger toward me for not being able to keep our plan to spend the weekend together. I was in school and working at the time, and had over-committed. In reality, our friendship had been devolving for quite some time, and came to an end in a loud, ugly and very public way.

        I didn't realize it until the dust had settled, but I walked into the restaurant ready for a fight. I had felt for some time that she was hard on me, difficult to please, and not understanding or supportive of my educationational path. I had already felt many times in the year prior that our friendship wasn't healthy for me, and that perhaps I needed to distance myself from her. Walking in, I didn't know if she was going to be kind about that fact that I had to cancel our weekend plans, only able to meet for that one dinner, or irate about it. It turned out to be a pleasent meal, until toward she end when she lashed out at me. The claws came out from both of us. I told her everthing that was on my mind, and she told me everyting that was on hers until there was nothing left to say.
        </p>

        In retrospect, I wish I had paid attention to my true emotions and recognized that I needed to end the friendship before it got so bad. In a way, I had not taken responsibility for my discontent with our friendship. I waited until it got nasty, until I had an excuse instead of maturely and repectfully (to her and to myself) of making the decision. What I learned from the experience is that when a relationship is going sour, it's important to recognize it and be honest with myself about it, and even discuss what is upsetting to me before it gets out of control

        A couple years later we ran into each other on the street. We went for a drink, we talked and cleared the air. Notabely, thought, she said something disparaging about my educational path. I lament the way our friendship ended, but I have no remose for the end of our friendship.
